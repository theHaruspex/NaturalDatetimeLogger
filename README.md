# Natural Datetime Logger

## Overview
Natural Datetime Logger is a lightweight Python logging utility that enhances Python's built-in `logging` module by formatting timestamps in a more natural language style (e.g., `"12:34:56PM, February 3rd"`). It provides an easy-to-use logging setup that supports:
- Console and file logging
- Optional debug log files
- Prevention of duplicate handlers

## Features
✅ Custom timestamp formatting (e.g., `"3:45:12PM, January 21st"`)  
✅ Automatically creates a `logs/` directory  
✅ Prevents duplicate log handlers  
✅ Supports an optional debug log file  
✅ Simple import and setup  

## Installation
You can install the package directly from GitHub like so:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/theHaruspex/NaturalDatetimeLogger.git
